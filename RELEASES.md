# Astra Monitor 25 - May 8 2024

### New features

-   **_Profiles_**: Astra Monitor now gains a **Profiles** feature. This new feature is designed to allow you to save and load different configurations of the extension. You can create as many profiles as you want and switch between them very easily. Right-clicking on an header, including the compact mode arrow, you can open the profiles menu and switch to another profile. You can also click on `Profiles` in the context menu to open the Profiles Settings page to create a new profile, clone the current one, rename it or delete it. We hope you enjoy this new feature and we are looking forward to your feedback.
    \
    \
    ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️ **_`Profiles` is a very experimental feature and it may have some bugs or break your configuration. Please export all your settings before experimenting with it._**
    You will always be able to recover your full settings if you exported them before starting to use experment with Profiles.

### Bug fixes

-   Fix edge case of multiline font size calculation for headers on HIDPI displays [[#109](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/109)][[#112](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/112)][[#114](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/114)]
-   Icon was missing for sensors header in the default settings
-   Missing file in hwmon monitoring could result in sensor listing returning an empty list.
-   Fixed an exception where no network interface is available

# Astra Monitor 24 - April 25 2024

### New features

-   **_Compact Mode_**: Astra Monitor now gains a **Compact Mode**. This new mode is designed to have a minimalistic footprint on your GNOME panel, until you decide to interact with it. If enabled you will see only an arrow icon on the panel. Hovering over it will reveal the full array of monitors you setup up. They will disappear when you move your mouse away. You can toggle to _"permanently"_ show the monitors by clicking on the arrow. Once you are done, you can click on the arrow again to hide them. Like the other features this is very customizable and you can choose a full array of options to make it fit your needs.
    \
    \
    You may find the new **Compact Mode** in the **Visualization** section of the **Preferences** panel. We hope you enjoy this new feature and we are looking forward to your feedback.

# Astra Monitor 23 - April 24 2024

### New features

-   **_New Preferences Panel_**: In response to the need for more space to accommodate additional sections in our preferences panel, and the burgeoning size of the prefs.js file, which had grown to over 3,500 lines, we have taken the opportunity to reorganize both the code and the user interface of our settings. The new preferences panel now mirrors the layout of the system settings panel, enhancing usability and scalability. It is designed to easily integrate numerous additional sections, paving the way for the swift incorporation of future features
    \
    \
    This is an ongoing process and the panel is not yet in its final form; it may undergo significant changes in the upcoming updates. We highly welcome and value your feedback.

# Astra Monitor 22 - April 23 2024

### Breaking changes

-   <ins>**Headers Height** functionality has been changed</ins>. Prior to this release, the default height was 28px and you could change it to fit your needs. Now it will defaults to disabled and the extension will try to accomodate the height of the panel. You still can override the value to be whatever you want in the settings. Upon update we automatically move your previous value to the new setting and disable it if it was set to 28px. **<ins>We still suggest you to check the value and eventually reset it to 0 it's not already</ins>, to check if the new behavior fits your needs**. [[#114](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/114)]

# Astra Monitor 20 - April 17 2024

### Advanced GPU Monitoring

As per our [Roadmap](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/blob/main/ROADMAP.md), in this release we are focusing on improving the GPU monitoring capabilities of Astra Monitor.

The new GPU monitoring is experimental right now and may cause some issues. You can disable it setting the **Main GPU** to `None` in the Preferences window.

Both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs are supported, but AMD support might be more accurate and complete because it's been tested more extensively. Intel GPUs are not supported yet for a lack of hardware to test on, but they will be in the future.

Here's a list of the new features and improvements:

-   **GPU Headers**: also GPUs can now have their dedicated headers and be visible in the top bar with a lot options to customize them. By default this is disabled and you can see the GPU info in the CPU Menu. However, you can enable it from the Preferences window. Beware that enabling this feature can lead to a slight increase of CPU usage because GPU data will be queried continuously.

-   **GPU Info**: hovering a the GPU name in the menu will show more info about it.

-   **GPU Activities**: when you pass your mouse over the GPU bar in the menu you are able to monitor a lot of GPU usage details.

-   **GPU VRAM**: also VRAM usage have its dedicated popup menu with a in-depth view of the VRAM usage.

-   **GPU Top Processes**: there is a list of the top processes using the GPU in the GPU Section (3 elements in the CPU menu, 5 in the GPU menu). As before, the popup menu will show more details about the processes.

-   **GPU Sensors**: a dedicated sensor section is available in the GPU section (1 element in the CPU menu, 3 in the GPU menu). To see all the sensors you can open the popup menu. Soon these sensors will be available in the sensors menu too.

-   **Tooltips**: like the other monitors, you can customize the tooltip for the GPU headers.

_Since this is a major change, we recommend you to test and report any issues you may encounter._

### New features

-   Improved UI performance at the expense of data responsiveness: you might see outdated or empty data for a few milliseconds when opening menus. Soon this will become a choice in preferences. [[#102](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/102)]

### Bug fixes

-   Improved IPs refreshing in Network Menu: now it refreshes on menu open if it's not been queried recently and you can trigger a refresh by clicking on it [[#108](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/108)]
-   Fixed title label not being centered in storage info popup [[#107](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor/issues/107)]
-   Allow bars to be empty when the value is zero
-   Fixed graph clipping not properly clipping rounded corners
-   Fixed Cpu Cores Bars occasionally exceeding borders on popup open
-   Importing settings saved from a future version to a past version caused the settings to be just reset, now all settings are properly imported from V20 onwards

# Astra Monitor 16 - March 26 2024

### Advanced Network Monitoring

As per our [Roadmap](https://github.com/AstraExt/astra-monitor?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap), in this release we are focusing on improving the Network monitoring capabilities of Astra Monitor. Here's a list of the new features and improvements:

-   **Public IP Address**: now you can see your public IPv4/IPv6 address in the Network Menu. This feature requires a remote API call to get the public IP address. We are using [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) as the default provider, which is a free and open source service. You can choose a different provider from the settings panel or disable this feature if you don't want to use it. We support every possible provider, included API created by yourself: the ip address will be matched with a regex to extract it from the response.

-   **Default Routes**: you can see default routing informations in the Network Menu.

-   **Device Info**: hovering a network interface will show you a lot more information about it.

-   **Wireless Networks**: the SSID of the connected wireless network is now visible in the Network Menu along with other useful information.

-   **Cumulative Upload/Download Bytes**: now you can see the total upload/download bytes since the last boot in the Network Menu for each network interface and globally.

-   **Packet Upload/Download**: now you can see the total packets uploaded/downloaded since the last boot in the Network Menu for each network interface and globally.

-   **Errors/Dropped Packets**: now you can see the total error/dropped packets since the last boot in the Network Menu for each network interface and globally.

# Astra Monitor 14 - March 11 2024

### Hwmon

**Hwmon** is a kernel-based subsystem that provides an interface to monitor various hardware sensors and it's the new default source for sensors. This will benefit the extension on many levels: performance, efficiency, reliability, and compatibility.
**lm-sensors** is not a required dependency anymore, but it will remain as an option if you have it installed, even though it's not recommended.

<u>We strongly encourage you to <span>manually move all your sensors to **Hwmon**</span> from the Astra Monitor Settings panel</u>. The sensors list in the menu is already on Hwmon by default, but you can still switch to **lm-sensors** if you want to from the settings panel.

_Since this is a major change, we recommend you to test all your sensors and report any issues you may encounter._
